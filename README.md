## Description

This is a personal project that I am working on to show case what I can do as a web developer. It started from me expanding on a group project that I did for UCSD's Full Stack Web-Development boot camp. Here is a link to the repository of that project: ![GitHub](https://github.com/iqwixn/tracked-fitness)

This is still a work in progress, and has a long way to go.
